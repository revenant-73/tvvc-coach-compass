# TVVC Constraint Compass
*A mobile-first coaching decision tool for focus, constraints, and live practice adaptation.*

---

## Overview

TVVC Constraint Compass is a **web-based, mobile-first coaching tool** designed to help club coaches decide:

- What to focus on (individual and team)
- What constraints to manipulate
- What behaviors to observe
- How to adjust activities live without changing the activity itself

The app **does not provide drills or games**.  
Instead, it supports *any activity* by shaping **attention, intention, and constraints**—allowing learning to emerge.

This tool reflects TVVC’s ecological, play-based, and adaptive coaching philosophy.

## Core Purpose

- Support **in-the-moment coaching decisions**

## Philosophy

This app does not tell coaches what to run.

It helps coaches decide:
- What matters
- What to change
- What to notice
- What to let emerge

**Joy is the training plan.**
